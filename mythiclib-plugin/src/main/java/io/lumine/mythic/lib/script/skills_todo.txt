-  = still to implement
** = implemented

GENERAL
-  support for scoreboards
-  support for metadata and variables on entities
-  support for bossbars
** support for scopes in variable mechanics
-  skill arguments: skills can cache source/target location/entity OR more info like projectiles
      - this would allow for mechanics to change the current direction of a projectile or thrown item
      - oop friendly generalisation of skill metadata

MECHANICS
** comets (OK with projectiles)
** helixes (circular geometry)
** forward, up, down, circular slashes (spherical geometry)
-  projectiles with gravity or bounces with some math normal calculations
-  throwable items
** 'skill' mechanic able to cast using a different skill metadata

CONDITIONS
** caster can target skill target?

TARGETERS
-  fix circle targeter using rotation matrixes (location)
-  sphere targeter (location)
** cone targeter (location)
